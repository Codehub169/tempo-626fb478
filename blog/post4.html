                <p><strong>Entry 047:</strong> The data stick feels like a lead weight in my pocket. It’s not the physical burden, but the information it contains – enough to bring OmniCorp’s illegal neuro-modification program crashing down. Easier said than done. They own this city, from the sky-raking towers to the grimy alleys I now call home. Every street corner camera, every data point, feels like a digital eye trained on me.</p>
                <p>Sleep is a luxury I can't afford. The stim-patches keep me awake, but the paranoia is a constant companion. Last night, a sanitation drone lingered too long outside my bolt-hole. Coincidence? In the Sprawl, there are no coincidences. Only calculated moves and brutal consequences. My old life, my apartment, my creds – all gone, wiped clean like I never existed. That’s how OmniCorp deals with loose ends.</p>
                <h3>The Price of Truth</h3>
                <p>Finding a secure comm-link to leak this data is like navigating a minefield blindfolded. Every netrunner I knew is either bought, broken, or buried. The few independent journalists brave enough to touch this story are ghosts themselves, operating from the deepest shadows of the digital underground. I need to find one. Soon. Before my luck, or the stims, run out.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "They say information is power. In Neo-Veridia, information is a death sentence if it falls into the wrong hands... or out of the right ones."
                </blockquote>
                <p>This diary, encrypted and broadcast on a dead-man switch, might be my only legacy. If you're reading this, it means OmniCorp found me. But it also means the data is out. Use it. Fight them. Don't let them silence the truth. The Sprawl needs more than just survivors; it needs saviors. And sometimes, a savior is just a whistleblower who ran out of places to hide.</p>
